I've created this project in bolt.new.
Why did I create this? Simple: because of my love for webnovels/light novels. (Wuxia, Xianxia, Xuanhuan, and similars)

When LightNovelPub shut down due to copyright issues, I realized how fragile access to these stories can be (I'll not pay, sorry WuxiaWorld).

Fortunately, tools like a Chrome extension that converts full novels from sites like NovelFull into EPUBs still exist.
And As someone who has nearly 8GB of light novels archived, looks good to have a really good EPub Reader with the functions ME, MYSELF, want in a website, around anothers functions that maybe someone use

So I built this site

Need help with setup? Feel free to send message to me on Discord: joaowars776. I’ll gladly assist — especially if you’re new to this kind of setup and found this repository through keywords like light novel, Wuxia, or Xianxia. I'm a private server youtuber, I help around 10 to 20 peoples per month nowadays (https://youtube.com/joaowars776), it's not bothering, and I'll not request you money, just ask me, trust bro.

⚙️ How to Run It
Make sure you have NodeJS installed. (https://nodejs.org/en)
Open a terminal (CMD) in root folder (epub-reader folder, download the zip, unpack on some folder, open and open CMD there).

Run the following commands, in this order:

<pre>npm install</pre>
<pre>npm run dev</pre>

That's it! Your site will launch — fully functional, just like the preview below.

The link to access this website is something like: http://localhost:5173/
